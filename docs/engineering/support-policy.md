Monthly upstream support review dates, accountable owner, and primary source links are tracked in the machine-readable [runtime support review ledger](runtime-support-review.json). `pnpm platform:audit` emits `current`, `due`, or `overdue` per runtime/toolchain; those states describe review freshness and do not claim the component is unsupported. Node.js end-of-life remains checked separately against the official release schedule.

## Initial CI service objectives (measurement targets, not guarantees)

- PR quick verification target: under 10 minutes wall-clock, measured over at least 10 representative affected runs. Not yet measured as a separate stable cohort.
- Full promotion suite target: under 20 minutes wall-clock, measured over at least 10 full runs. Ten successful full push runs are observed at 2.57–3.73 minutes (3.23-minute mean); see [M0.06 evidence](../roadmap/evidence/M0.06.md). This supports the current CI workflow budget only; it is not an application latency SLO.
- If targets are missed, report slow jobs and separate required gates; never omit PostgreSQL/browser/security merely to hit the target.
- Browser failure reports/traces/screenshots/video use explicit 7-day artifact retention in CI. Repository-level artifact/log retention is inherited (`artifact_and_log_retention_days` is unset in the repository API); actual log retention remains unverified.
- Scheduled reliability: GitHub schedules are best-effort; workflows must be manually runnable and M8.10 must find stale/missed runs.

Measure one workflow's wall-clock duration with `gh api repos/bjo163/moonwitness-xi/actions/runs/RUN_ID --jq '[.run_started_at,.updated_at]'`; convert the timestamps to minutes. This includes queue time and is a conservative workflow-level budget, not a job-duration or app-latency benchmark.

Before calling these supported policy, confirm the chosen runtime is still maintained, CI/container parity passes, and dependency compatibility is verified. Upgrade supported major versions with dedicated matrix and release notes.
